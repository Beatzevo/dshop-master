## Origin Contracts

This repo contains the Solidity contracts powering Origin Protocol DShop,
consisting of:

**OGN Token** Origin Token is built on the ERC20 standard, inheriting from Open
Zeppelin contracts with a few customizations.

**Marketplace** The marketplace contract facilitates transactions between buyers
and sellers. It supports escrow, arbitration and transactions in Eth and ERC20
tokens, as well as incorporating a commission model and staking in OGN.
